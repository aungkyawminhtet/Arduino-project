pnp transistor
npn transistor n=negative p=positive
in digital meter red is negative , black is positive
in analog meter red is positive , black is negative
if check positive increase num in meter this is base = pnp
if check negative increase num in meter this is base = npn

check another node if increase num in meter this is  collector
left node is emitter
